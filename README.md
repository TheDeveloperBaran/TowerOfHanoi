# TowerOfHanoi
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving a stack of disks of different sizes from one rod to another, while adhering to a strict set of rules. The puzzle consists of three rods and a number of disks of varying diameters, initially stacked in order of size on one rod.

The objective of the game is to move the entire stack of disks to another rod, with the following constraints:

Only one disk may be moved at a time
A disk may only be placed on top of another disk that is larger than itself or on an empty rod
The disks must be moved in such a way that the original stack is recreated on the destination rod.
The puzzle may be solved for any number of disks, but the minimum number of moves required to solve the puzzle increases exponentially with the number of disks. The Tower of Hanoi is often used as an educational tool in computer science and mathematics, as it provides a good example of recursive algorithms and problem-solving techniques.
